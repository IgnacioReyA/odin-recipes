        <h2>Close Up</h2>
        <p>This recipe is the best for a chocolate mousse. Never have I ever 
            tried a mousse as good as the one you are going to make with this
            recipe. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This recipe I found it in a cooking book of Pablo Massay. He is an 
            incredible chef with so much talent.
